# The workspace guest's NixOS system configuration (#250, #274).
#
# This module IS the guest: the image build (nix/guest-nixos.nix)
# evaluates it to produce the kernel, initrd, and rootfs, and the
# image ships it at /etc/nixos/ — configuration.nix imports it —
# so `nixos-rebuild switch` inside a running workspace re-evaluates
# the same configuration the image was built from. One source of
# truth: every contract item (docs/images.md) is a declarative
# setting here, and a rebuild that drops one fails the same battery
# the image build runs, not a workspace's first boot.
#
# The module must stay guest-evaluable: it references only nix/
# files that ship beside it (./console-helper-pkg.nix,
# ./agent-toolchain.nix, ./guest-pi-extension.ts and the shrinkwrap
# pair the toolchain build reads) and sources under ../src that
# ship the same way — the image bakes the whole import chain into
# /etc/nixos.
#
# The file is imported TWICE with two different nixpkgs: the image
# build's pinned revision, and — inside a rebuilt workspace — the
# nixpkgs source the image baked into the store. Everything it
# declares must hold under both.
