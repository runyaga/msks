# The agent toolchain shared by both guest images (#266, #268):
# the digest-pinned upstream artifacts and the offline builds,
# factored out of the Debian image when the NixOS image came to
# ship the same tools. One file owns every pin, so a bump moves
# both images together.
#
# The derivations are pin-agnostic about staging: pi and Claude
# Code build into npm's global layout (lib/node_modules) without
# bin links — the Debian overlay and the NixOS profile each make
# their own, at the published bin (dist/bundle/cli.js for pi, the
# wrapper's bin stub for Claude Code). herdr installs the release's
# static binary with its license. Each image lands them its own
# way — Debian under /usr/local from the overlay tree, NixOS
# through the system profile. Node itself is the one pin each image
# owns separately: the Debian image stages the official standalone
# tarball (Debian's own Node is older than pi's engines floor),
# while the NixOS image uses nixpkgs' Node — the platform's own
# packaging where it exists is the rule, and on NixOS it exists.
#
# Everything here stays pure derivations: pi's dependency closure
# is prefetched against its shrinkwrap (npmDepsHash) and installed
# offline, and no build step runs Node or npm scripts.
