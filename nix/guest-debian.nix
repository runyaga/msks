# Guest VM assets for direct kernel boot on cloud-hypervisor (#5).
#
# Everything a microvm needs comes out of this file as plain store
# paths, built from the pinned nixpkgs by pure derivations: the build
# runs on any Linux host with nix and touches nothing outside the
# repo.
#
# The root filesystem is Debian 13 (trixie), straight from Debian's
# official genericcloud cloud image (#30, #41): real Debian with
# PID 1, apt, Debian's own modules — and Debian's own socat (built
# WITH_VSOCK) serving the vsock console. The kernel is Debian's
# *generic* flavor of the same upstream version (#96) — it builds
# virtio-pci in and carries the KVM modules, so one pin serves the
# workspace guest and its nested-KVM workspaces. The minimal
# initramfs msks builds carries the six modules the generic flavor
# needs to mount the ext4 root (the cloud flavor #37 chose built
# ext4 in; the ~2.5s it dodged was Debian's stock 34MB MODULES=most
# archive, not the flavor — the six-module initrd costs tens of
# milliseconds). The image is pinned by its dated cloud.debian.org
# URL and sha512; the kernel by its deb.debian.org pool URL and
# sha256 ("latest" is a moving pointer; dated builds stay
# published).
#
#   $out/vmlinux            - Debian's generic kernel (bzImage with
#                             the PVH entry point on x86_64, the
#                             arm64 boot Image on aarch64 — see
#                             nix/guest-platform.nix). Named
#                             "vmlinux" to match the
#                             TEST_VMLINUX contract;
#                             guest-manifest.json records the actual
#                             format.
#   $out/initrd             - msks-built minimal initramfs: busybox,
#                             the six root-mount modules, mount
#                             root, switch_root.
#   $out/rootfs.ext4        - the extracted Debian tree as a fresh
#                             ext4 image: the pristine base each
#                             workspace's overlay copies on write
#                             from (#14); guests mount it rw.
#   $out/guest-manifest.json - artifact names + the boot cmdline.
#
# Extraction is unprivileged — debugfs rdump, no mount — and rdump
# flattens inode metadata: files land build-user owned with the
# setuid/setgid bits dropped. The build records the source image's
# own mode/uid/gid for every inode at dump time and the fakeroot
# pack stage restores the whole set (#169 restored only the special
# bits; #179 widened it to ownership after mandb lost its man:man
# cache): the msks user (#63) needs working sudo, and
# package-maintained directories keep the owners their postinsts
# assume. rdump also drops xattrs and hardlinks; the pinned base
# ships no xattrs that matter (spot-checked), and the hardlink
# flattening is deliberate (see the root.tar comment below).
#
# Evaluate through the msks-build-guest script (it pins nixpkgs
# to the devenv.lock revision); `nix-build nix/guest.nix -A guest`
# with plain NIX_PATH also works when the pinned channel is
# acceptable.
