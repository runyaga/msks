# The msksd configuration file

`msksd` reads its settings from a YAML file, from `MSKSD_*`
environment variables, and from built-in defaults. The file is the
durable home for a deployment's settings — committed to the
deployment's own storage and human-reviewable — while the
environment variables stay available as per-invocation overrides.

## Precedence

Values resolve in this order (highest first):

1. **Environment variables** (`MSKSD_*`) — override the file
2. **The config file** — the YAML file `msksd` resolves at startup
3. **Built-in defaults** — the settings dataclass defaults

A variable set in the process wins over the same key in the file; a
key set nowhere uses the default. An environment variable set to an
empty string is the unset form: the file value applies.

## The `--config` flag

`msksd` resolves its config file in three modes:

| Invocation                           | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `msksd`                              | Reads `$MSKSD_CONFIG_DIR/msksd.yaml` (default `~/.config/msksd/msksd.yaml`, honoring `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`). A missing file is **generated** as a commented template pointing at this chapter — the first run writes the file so its location is discoverable, and the daemon then runs on environment variables and defaults. |
| `msksd --config /path/to/msksd.yaml` | Reads exactly that file. A missing file is a startup error naming the path. Explicit paths are never auto-generated.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `msksd --config=none`                | Reads environment variables and built-in defaults only — the in-tree user is the smoke-test daemon; the deployment-host module passes an explicit `--config` path.                                                                                                                                                          |

`MSKSD_CONFIG_DIR` is read before anything else and exists only as
an environment variable: the config file cannot relocate the
directory it lives in, so the tree root must be resolvable before
the file is located.

The dev daemon runs bare: `scripts/dev-daemon.sh` sets
`MSKSD_CONFIG_DIR` to the devenv root (and the devenv shell presets
the same value, so a hand-run `msksd` resolves the same file), so
its durable settings live in `<repo>/msksd.yaml` — generated as
the commented template on first daemon start, untracked (local
edits are personal). The environment the script exports (API port,
state dir, egress wiring) wins over file values under the
precedence above.

## Key mapping

A config-file key is its `MSKSD_*` variable with the prefix stripped
and lowercased — one rule, no lookup table:

| Environment variable     | Config-file key    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| `MSKSD_PORT`             | `port`             |
| `MSKSD_VSOCK_SHELL_PORT` | `vsock_shell_port` |
| `MSKSD_EGRESS_SUBNET`    | `egress_subnet`    |
| `MSKSD_STATE_DIR`        | `state_dir`        |

The file is flat — one key per setting, no sections. For example:

```yaml
host: 0.0.0.0
port: 8660
vsock_shell_port: 1023
```

sets the same settings `MSKSD_HOST`, `MSKSD_PORT`, and
`MSKSD_VSOCK_SHELL_PORT` would. Either spelling is recoverable from
the other by the rule, and the daemon enforces it in code: the
key↔variable table is derived mechanically, so the two forms cannot
drift apart.

The underscore is the canonical spelling, and a hyphen may be
written for it: `egress-dns-upstream` and `egress_dns_upstream` are
one key spelled two ways (the same rule the `llm_models` entries'
keys follow), so an operator used to kebab-case YAML can write it
naturally. Both spellings of one key in the same file is a startup
error naming the two spellings, and the valid-keys list an unknown
key reports is the snake_case one.

One mapping detail worth knowing: **`state_dir` places the database
too.** `MSKSD_STATE_DIR` feeds both the local driver's workspace
artifacts and the server's sqlite database (`<state_dir>/msks.db`);
there is no separate `db_path` key, matching the environment
variable, which also drives both.

### Native scalar types

Numeric, boolean, and string fields accept their natural YAML
scalars: `port: 8660`, `access_log: true`,
`socket_wait_timeout_s: 12.5`. Quoted strings (`port: "8660"`) work
everywhere and parse identically. A key with no value
(`bootstrap_token:`) is the unset form — the environment (for its
variable) and then the default apply. Values must be scalars: a list
or mapping where a number, boolean, or string belongs is a startup
error, and so is a duplicate key — a second `port:` does not silently
win. Merge keys (`<<: *anchor`) are refused with their own message: the
file is flat and every key is spelled out.

Booleans deserve care. `true` and `false` are the spellings to use;
PyYAML also parses the YAML 1.1 forms `yes`/`no`/`on`/`off` as
booleans, so those work too. The single letters `y` and `n` are
plain strings to YAML 1.1 — a boolean key set to either reads as
**false**, the same string rule the environment variable follows —
and a bare `1` or `0` is an integer, which also reads as false.
Write `true` or `false`.

### Unknown keys fail fast

A key the daemon does not know is a startup error naming the key and
the valid ones — a typo'd `prot` fails at boot instead of being
silently ignored. (The environment has no such guard: a typo'd
variable name is simply never read.)

Invalid values fail the same way whichever source they came from,
and the error message names the `MSKSD_*` variable —
`vmm_driver: firecracker` reports `MSKSD_VMM_DRIVER must be one of
('local',)`. Non-finite numbers (`.nan`, `.inf`) are rejected
from either source.

## Key reference

The tables below group the keys by the subsystem that reads them;
the file itself carries them all at one level.

## SIGHUP reload

Send `SIGHUP` to a running `msksd` and it re-reads the config file
(and the environment) into its live settings. Subsystems read
settings off the app's state at call time, so the swap propagates
with no per-module reconfiguration — a changed `egress_subnet` or
`host_name` applies to the next request that reads it.

Several things keep their startup values until a restart — a
reload naming a new one changes nothing:

- the listener's address, port, TLS material, and access logging
  (bound — and, for the access log, snapshotted into the listener's
  config — at startup)
- `state_dir` and the database path it places (the engine is open,
  and the local driver resolves every workspace's artifacts from the
  state dir live — moving it mid-run would orphan running
  workspaces, so the daemon latches the startup value)
- `default_image` (imported into the catalog once, at first boot)
- the watcher scan's `event_poll_s` (sampled at loop start): both the
  workspace status reconcile and the state-disk pressure probe
  (#184) ride it
- the egress machinery's startup inputs: `egress_enabled` (the
  subsystem latches its state when the daemon boots) and the base
  NAT masquerade's `egress_uplink` (per-workspace firewall rules
  read the live setting, but the base table that actually
  masquerades out the uplink keeps its startup value — change
  `egress_uplink` only with a restart scheduled)

A config that fails to load or validate is refused: the daemon
reports the error on stderr and keeps the previous settings. A
default-path file deleted since startup is likewise refused rather
than regenerated — a reload is not a first run, and regenerating the
template would silently revert every file-set value to its default.

## Notes for tooling

- A bare `alembic` CLI run derives its database URL the way a bare
  `msksd` would: the default config file when one is present (never
  generated by `alembic`), else environment variables and defaults.
  The daemon always passes its own live path programmatically. Use
  `MSKSD_CONFIG_DIR`/`MSKSD_STATE_DIR` when the hand-run migration
  must reach a database not at the default location.
- The generated template is written once, with `0700` on its
  directory, and never overwrites an existing file — a concurrent
  `msksd` that wins the race is treated as "the file is there now".
