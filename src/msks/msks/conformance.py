"""The image conformance check (#258).

``msks image check <archive>`` boots an image exactly the way a
workspace boots — same driver, same overlay/home/seed artifacts,
same console path — and verifies the guest contract point by point
(``docs/images.md``, "What a guest must provide"). An image author
runs it on any host with ``/dev/kvm`` before publishing; the daemon
keeps verifying layout only at import, so the check is a
pre-import gate the operator runs, not one the daemon enforces.

This module composes the real app (``msks.app``) rather than a
client-side reimplementation: the point of the check is to exercise
the same machinery a workspace boot exercises. It therefore pulls
server-side composition into any process that imports it — the
client reaches for it only inside ``msks image check`` (a
deliberate deferred import, marked for the gate), so every remote
subcommand's process stays free of the server stack.

The check is read-only toward the host except for three things it
owns outright: a throwaway state dir under ``/tmp`` (removed unless
``--keep``), the workspace VMs it boots inside it, and — in the
``--egress`` pass — the host's ``ip_forward`` sysctl, which it sets
to 1 for the pass and restores to whatever it found.
