"""The per-VM NFQUEUE consumer (#69).

One consumer per interactive workspace, bound to that workspace's
own queue number (derived from its pool slice): the kernel hands
the first packet of every NEW flow to this loop, which holds it
(:meth:`msks.consent.ConsentEngine.hold`) until a verdict — allow,
deny, timeout — then applies it:

- allow → pin the destination in the per-VM ``allows`` set (the
  kernel expires it at the verdict's duration) and accept the SYN;
  conntrack carries the connection from there.
- deny → drop the SYN and pin a short REJECT (tcp-reset) element
  so the *retransmit* is answered with an RST — a dropped SYN alone
  leaves the guest's ``connect()`` hanging on the kernel's ~127 s
  retransmit timer, and the RST is what makes the refusal fast.
  (klangk's sidecar forged the RST itself through a raw socket; the
  daemon service user holds only CAP_NET_ADMIN and
  CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE, so here the kernel forges it via the
  REJECT rule instead — same effect, no extra capability.)

Deferred verdicts: the callback never blocks — each held SYN is
retained and handed to a task, so distinct flows hold concurrently
and one slow decider cannot serialize another workspace's
verdicts. Retransmits of a held SYN drop (the in-flight set); of a
decided flow, they reuse the cached verdict (the verdict cache,
keyed by the connection tuple — which is what makes ``once``
per-connection: a new source port is a cache miss and re-prompts).

Name scoping on shared addresses (#304): a destination two live
names resolve to carries no address-keyed allow pin (the manager
skips it), and a deny on such a destination refuses only its own
connection — the RST element is keyed by the connection's source
port, so the co-resident's connections never see it.

``netfilterqueue`` ships with every Linux install (consent is the
normal posture for workspaces): the Linux devenv shells build it
against nixpkgs' libnetfilter_queue/libnfnetlink, and the package
closure builds it via ``nix/netfilterqueue-pkg.nix``. A macOS
install carries the client and leaves the binding out, since the
library is Linux-only. The import stays guarded — an install
without the library fails closed at bind time as a named refusal
(the workspace boot refuses rather than running an unanswered
queue), never silently.
