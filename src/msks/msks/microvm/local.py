"""Local backend: one cloud-hypervisor process per workspace VM (#1).

Per-workspace layout under ``<state_dir>/vms/<workspace_id>/``:

- ``api.sock``  — the CH REST socket this process serves
- ``ch.pid``    — the CH process id (restart-surviving kill path)
- ``ch.log``    — the VMM's own stderr
- ``serial.log``— the guest serial console (file-backed serial device)
- ``vsock.sock``— the vsock device's unix socket (the console proxy
                 dials it with the CONNECT handshake, #21)

Shutdown model, matching how the VMM really behaves: a bare
``cloud-hypervisor --api-socket`` is a daemon that keeps running after
the guest powers off (``vm.info`` returns to a non-running state), so
graceful shutdown is PUT /vm.power-button (the guest's handler runs
the clean poweroff) -> poll the guest down -> SIGTERM the VMM -> wait
for process exit, all under one deadline.
