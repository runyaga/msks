"""Opt-in smoke tests against real infrastructure.

- Local: boots a real cloud-hypervisor VM when TEST_VMLINUX and
  TEST_ROOTFS point at guest artifacts (and /dev/kvm is
  accessible); skipped otherwise. The msks-build-guest script
  sets all of these from the guest state dir
  (`.devenv/state/guest` by default) automatically (see conftest.py
  and msks.guestassets); the stock nixpkgs kernel also needs the initrd
  (TEST_INITRD) and the cmdline the manifest carries
  (TEST_CMDLINE) to reach userspace.

These never count toward the coverage gate (the package is fully
covered by the faked-transport unit suites).

This module is the suite's shared harness: the env-tunable constants,
the skip markers, and the helpers every area module uses. The tests
live in one module per area beside this one — test_boot_lifecycle,
test_user_data, test_console, test_egress,
test_dev_workspace, test_ssh_forward, and test_identity — and
import what they need from here. The harness
lives in the package `__init__` itself rather than a harness.py the
package would re-export because test_smoke_harness.py pins
run_in_console's retry logic by monkeypatching attributes on
``test_smoke``: the functions must read CONSOLE_TIMEOUT_S and
CONSOLE_ATTEMPTS from this module's namespace for those pins to bite.
